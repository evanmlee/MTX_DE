# MTX_DE
R scripts for metatranscriptomic differential expression analysis.

# DESeq2
Implementations of DESeq2 include either community-sum or taxon-specific scaling (CSS and TSS, respectively). 
They also variably use gene-level DNA abundances as normalization factors (CSS DNA and TSS DNA, respectively).

# MTXmodel (Zhang_MTX)
MTXmodel implementations M1 (no DNA abundances), M5 (genome level), and M6 (gene level DNA) are included. 
Both 'strict' and 'lenient' rna_dna_filt values are used. 

# MPRAnalyze
Both community-sum and taxon-specific scaling are present with gene-level DNA abundances (MPRAnalyze_mgx and MPRAnalyze_TSS_mgx)
